# Heart-Transplant-Mortality-Prediction

This repository contains R code for predicting one-year mortality rates in heart transplant patients based on donor matching characteristics. The analysis explores the relationship between donor-recipient matching variables (particularly RV mass ratio) and post-transplant outcomes.

**Overview**
The project analyzes a comprehensive heart transplant database to identify factors that predict one-year mortality or retransplantation. It examines various subgroups including:

LVAD vs. non-LVAD patients
Transplants before and after 2006
Different gender combinations between donors and recipients

**Repository Structure**
data_preprocessing.R: Loads and preprocesses the raw data files
data_visualization.R: Creates visualizations for exploratory data analysis
modeling.R: Implements machine learning models using H2O framework

**Installation**

**Prerequisites**
R (version â‰¥ 4.0.0)
RStudio (recommended)

**Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-transplant-mortality-prediction.git
cd heart-transplant-mortality-prediction

2. Install required packages:
  install.packages(c("dplyr", "readr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "h2o"))

**Data**
**Required Data Structure**
This analysis works with heart transplant data that includes donor and recipient characteristics. The essential data elements include:

- Target variable: One-year mortality or retransplant status (One_year_mortality_retransplant)
- Key predictors:
   - Right ventricle (RV) mass measurements for both donor and recipient
   - Demographic information (age, gender)
   - Clinical variables (creatinine levels, bilirubin, etc.)
   - Transplant characteristics (ischemic time, ventilator status)

**Data Subsets**
The analysis examines multiple clinically relevant subgroups:
1. Full cohort: All available heart transplant cases
2. LVAD stratification: Cases with and without left ventricular assist devices
3. Era comparison: Transplants performed before and after 2006
4. Gender matching: Different donor-recipient gender combinations

**Data Sources**
While this code was developed using specific UNOS registry data, it can be adapted for similar heart transplant datasets from other registries or centers. The preprocessing scripts can be modified to accommodate different column names or data structures.

**Data Privacy**
This repository does not include any patient data. Users must supply their own data files that adhere to appropriate ethical guidelines and data use agreements.


**Usage**

**Command Line**
1. Run data processing:
   Rscript data_preprocessing.R
2. Generate Visualizations:
   Rscript data_visualization.R
3. Train and evaluate models:
   Rscript modeling.R
   
**RStudio**
You can also run each script directly in RStudio:

1. Open the project in RStudio
2. Open each script file
3. Click "Source" or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S)

**Example Output**
After running the scripts, you'll find:
- Processed data files in the data/ directory
- Visualizations in the plots/ directory
- Model files and comparison metrics in the models/ directory

**Key Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Filtering relevant columns and calculating donor-recipient ratios
- Visualization: Boxplots showing RV mass ratio differences between outcome groups
- Modeling: Multiple machine learning approaches including:
   - Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
   - Random Forests
   - XGBoost
   - Deep Learning models
   - Stacked ensembles

**Results**
The models evaluate the impact of various factors on heart transplant outcomes, with particular focus on:
- RV mass donor-recipient ratio
- LVAD support status
- Transplant era (before vs. after 2006)
- Gender matching between donors and recipients

Performance metrics including AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) are used to evaluate model performance.

**Analysis Workflow**
1. Data Processing: The original Python code processed multiple datasets representing different patient subgroups. The R implementation maintains this structure while improving code organization and reusability.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Boxplots visualize the relationship between RV mass ratio and mortality outcomes across different patient groups.
3. Machine Learning: Multiple models are trained and compared, with performance metrics captured for future reference.

**Notes on Code Conversion**
This codebase was converted from Python to R while improving:
- Code organization and modularity
- Consistent variable naming
- Comprehensive documentation
- Error handling
- Output organization (data, plots, and models in separate directories)
